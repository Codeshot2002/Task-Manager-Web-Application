- Create, Update, and Delete tasks: Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.
- Database connected: The application is connected to a database to store user information and tasks.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Express.js, Node.js
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Database: [Specify your choice of database here, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL]
